## Getting Started

This project is set up to run in Firebase Studio.

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Node.js (v18+ recommended)
    *   Firebase CLI installed and configured (`npm install -g firebase-tools`, `firebase login`)
    *   A Firebase project set up with Authentication, Firestore, Cloud Functions, Hosting, and Storage enabled.

2.  **Environment Variables:**
    *   Create a `.env` file in the root of your project.
    *   Add your Firebase project configuration and any necessary API keys:
        ```env
        # Firebase Client SDK Config (from your Firebase project settings)
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your_measurement_id # Optional, for Analytics

        # Genkit/Google AI API Key (if not configured via gcloud CLI)
        GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_ai_api_key
        # or specific Genkit environment variables as needed

        # Other API Keys (if you implement them)
        # HUGGING_FACE_API_KEY=your_hugging_face_api_key (for functions config, not .env)
        # HIPAASPACE_API_KEY=your_hipaaspace_api_key (for functions config, not .env)
        ```
    *   **Important:** For API keys used in Firebase Cloud Functions (like `HUGGING_FACE_API_KEY` or `HIPAASPACE_API_KEY`), set them using Firebase Functions configuration for security:
        ```bash
        firebase functions:config:set yourservice.api_key="YOUR_ACTUAL_KEY"
        # e.g., firebase functions:config:set huggingface.api_key="hf_..."
        ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # If you have a functions directory, also:
    # cd functions && npm install && cd ..
    ```

4.  **Run the Development Server:**
    *   For the Next.js app:
        ```bash
        npm run dev
        ```
    *   For Genkit (if running flows locally for testing):
        ```bash
        npm run genkit:dev
        ```
        (Ensure your `src/ai/dev.ts` is configured correctly).

5.  **Build and Deploy:**
    *   Build the Next.js app:
        ```bash
        npm run build
        ```
    *   Deploy to Firebase:
        ```bash
        firebase deploy
        ```
        (This will typically deploy Hosting, Functions, Firestore rules, etc., based on your `firebase.json` configuration).
