## Getting Started

This project is set up to run in Firebase Studio.

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Node.js (v18+ recommended)
    *   Firebase CLI installed and configured (`npm install -g firebase-tools`, `firebase login`)
    *   A Firebase project set up with Authentication, Firestore, Cloud Functions, Hosting, and Storage enabled.

2.  **Environment Variables:**
    *   Create a `.env` file in the root of your project.
    *   Add your Firebase project configuration and any necessary API keys:
        ```env
        # Firebase Client SDK Config (from your Firebase project settings)
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your_measurement_id # Optional, for Analytics

        # Genkit/Google AI API Key (if not configured via gcloud CLI)
        GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_ai_api_key
        # or specific Genkit environment variables as needed

        # Other API Keys (if you implement them)
        # HUGGING_FACE_API_KEY=your_hugging_face_api_key (for functions config, not .env)
        # HIPAASPACE_API_KEY=your_hipaaspace_api_key (for functions config, not .env)
        ```
    *   **Important:** For API keys used in Firebase Cloud Functions (like `HUGGING_FACE_API_KEY` or `HIPAASPACE_API_KEY`), set them using Firebase Functions configuration for security:
        ```bash
        firebase functions:config:set yourservice.api_key="YOUR_ACTUAL_KEY"
        # e.g., firebase functions:config:set huggingface.api_key="hf_..."
        ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # If you have a functions directory, also:
    # cd functions && npm install && cd ..
    ```

4.  **Run the Development Server:**
    *   For the Next.js app:
        ```bash
        npm run dev
        ```
    *   For Genkit (if running flows locally for testing):
        ```bash
        npm run genkit:dev
        ```
        (Ensure your `src/ai/dev.ts` is configured correctly).

5.  **Build and Deploy:**
    *   Build the Next.js app:
        ```bash
        npm run build
        ```
    *   Deploy to Firebase:
        ```bash
        firebase deploy
        ```
        (This will typically deploy Hosting, Functions, Firestore rules, etc., based on your `firebase.json` configuration).

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Google AI / Genkit Errors (e.g., 403 Forbidden, API_KEY_SERVICE_BLOCKED)

If you encounter errors like `[GoogleGenerativeAI Error]: Error fetching from ... [403 Forbidden] Requests to this API generativelanguage.googleapis.com ... are blocked` or similar:

This usually means there's an issue with your Google Cloud Project configuration for the API key being used. The error message often includes your project ID (e.g., `consumer":"projects/YOUR_PROJECT_ID"`).

**Action Required in Google Cloud Console for project `YOUR_PROJECT_ID`:**

1.  **Enable the API:**
    *   Go to the Google Cloud Console: [https://console.cloud.google.com/](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
    *   Ensure you have the correct project selected.
    *   Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Library".
    *   Search for "**Generative Language API**" (it might also be listed as "Google AI Generative Language API" or similar).
    *   Click on it and ensure it is **Enabled**. If not, enable it.
    *   _Alternatively, if you plan to use models via Vertex AI, ensure the "Vertex AI API" is enabled._

2.  **Check Billing:**
    *   Most Google Cloud APIs, including generative AI services, require a billing account to be linked to your project and billing to be enabled.
    *   Navigate to "Billing" in the Google Cloud Console and verify that your project is associated with an active billing account.

3.  **Check API Key Restrictions:**
    *   If you've set restrictions on your API key (e.g., API restrictions, application restrictions), ensure it's allowed to access the "Generative Language API".
    *   Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials".
    *   Select your API key.
    *   Review and adjust "API restrictions" and "Application restrictions" as needed. For initial testing, you might temporarily set API restrictions to "Don't restrict key" and then tighten them later.

4.  **Valid API Key:**
    *   Double-check that the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` in your `.env` file (for local development) or your environment configuration (for deployed environments) is correct and has not expired or been revoked.

After making any necessary changes in the Google Cloud Console, it might take a few minutes for them to propagate. Then, try running your application again.
